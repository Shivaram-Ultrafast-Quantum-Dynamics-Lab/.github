# Shivaram Ultrafast Quantum Dynamics Laboratory

This organization contains code that belongs to the Ultrafast Quantum Dynamics Laboratory at the Purdue University Department of Physics and Astronomy, directed by Professor Niranjan Shivaram. It serves as both a place to organize, version, and document code used by our group for data acquisition, data analysis, and theoretical simulations. It also exists to share that code with the public.

This organization and the repositories within it will constantly be a work in progress. As such, not all of the code in this organization may be public at a given time. If you would like to reach out for some details regarding code that is currently private, please reach out to Professor Shivaram at niranjan@purdue.edu. Please also see our licensing to respect our intellectual property rights if you want to use or fork any of our code.
