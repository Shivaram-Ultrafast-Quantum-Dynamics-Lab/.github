# Shivaram Ultrafast Quantum Dynamics Laboratory

This organization and its repositories contains code that belongs to the Ultrafast Quantum Dynamics Laboratory at Purdue University, directed by Professor Niranjan Shivaram. It serves as both a place to organize, version, and document code used by our group for data acquisition, data analysis, and theoretical simulations, as well as share that code with the public.

This workspace and the repositories within it will constantly be a work in progress. If you would like to reach out for some details regarding code that is currently private, please reach out to Professor Shivaram at niranjan@purdue.edu. Please see our licensing to respect our intellectual property rights if you ddecide to use any of our code.
